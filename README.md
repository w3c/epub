# Entry point for the W3C EPUB Recommendation

This is the entry point on GitHub for the various repositories and documents on the W3C EPUB Recommendation. The Recommendation itself is maintained and developed further by the [W3C Publication Maintenance (PM) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pm/). 

EPUB consists of three Recommendations: the authoring format, reading system, and accessibility specifications. The three recommendations are accompanied by a number of Working Group Notes on such diverse topics as multiple rendition, text-to-speech, or accessibility techniques. All of these documents are developed on the [GitHub `epub-spec` repository](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/); that is where issues, comments, or pull requests can be raised. Additionally, the Working Group maintains a separate [EPUB Testing repository](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/) which contains a large set of publicly available [EPUB tests](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/).

The latest stable release of EPUB is version 3.3. The [EPUB 3 Overview for EPUB 3.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-33/) provides a good entry point, including links to all the documents. The document also provides a short overview of the history of EPUB.

The PM Working Group is currently working on version 3.4; see [EPUB 3 Overview for EPUB 3.4](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-34/) for a detailed reference for that version. The [latest charter](https://www.w3.org/2025/02/pmwg-charter.html) of the Working Group gives some details on the possible additions to the standard.

This repository does not accept issues or pull requests. Please, use the [specification](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/) and the [EPUB testing](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/) repositories or, possibly, the GitHub [repository of the Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/pm-wg) itself.
